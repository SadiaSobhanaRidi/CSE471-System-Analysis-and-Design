**Project**: ***Covid19_Patient_Tracker_System***<br />
The COVID patient tracker system is designed to streamline the management of the pandemic for patients, hospital authorities, and the government. There are three main actors in this system: the patient, the hospital authority, and the government. Patients are the primary users, while hospital authorities and the government play crucial supporting roles.

To get started, all actors log in with a unique username and password, choosing either Bengali or English. Once logged in, patients can access a wealth of real-time information about their preferred hospital, including ICU bed availability, ambulances, emergency contacts, doctor appointment times, oxygen supply, and vaccine stocks. With just a few clicks, they can book doctor appointments, COVID tests, and vaccine slots. If slots are full, they can request to join a queue and get notified when a slot opens up. Patients can also summon emergency ambulances or doctors and will receive instant notifications for successful bookings. Plus, they have the flexibility to cancel bookings anytime.

Hospital authorities keep the system updated daily with the latest data on vaccine amounts, ICU beds, doctor schedules, emergency contacts, and COVID statistics. They test for COVID variants and send out confirmations to patients. They also verify patient bookings and send approvals, ensuring smooth appointments. Additionally, they report daily COVID statistics to the government, highlighting affected, deceased, and recovered cases.

The government uses this data to monitor the pandemic's progress. By logging in, they can see updated COVID statistics and take decisive actions, such as enforcing lockdowns in high-risk areas. They also use the system to send important public health messages, like reminders to wear masks and sanitize hands, keeping the community informed and safe.

This innovative system makes managing COVID-19 efficient and user-friendly, providing essential services and information at your fingertips.
